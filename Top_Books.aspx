115%">THE FIFTH SEASON<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
        By N.K. Jemisin (Orbit)</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
        In this fantastical tale, Earth has gone through cataclysmic seasonal shifts, and a new branch of humans has arisen. Called the orogene, these humans can shift the Earth and atmosphere to protect themselves — or to harm others. If discovered by guardians when they’re young, the orogene are rounded up and trained in special centers. Within this apocalyptic landscape, N.K. Jemisin lyrically narrates the lives of three orogene women: Essun, whose son has just been brutally murdered by her husband; Damaya, a young girl taken from her home to be trained by a vicious Guardian; and Syenite, who must breed with one of the most powerful orogenes. Amid these and other difficulties, each woman discovers a secret about mysterious obelisks that suddenly appear and can channel an orogene’s energy. Jemisin’s novel sets up her Earth trilogy with gorgeous writing and captivating plot twists.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
        BY TA-NEHISI COATES</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
        Between the World and Me” is a riveting meditation on the state of race in America that has arrived at a tumultuous moment in America’s history of racial strife. What it does better than any other recent book is relentlessly drive home the point that “racism is a visceral experience. . . . It dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth.” To be black in the ghetto of Coates’s youth “was to be naked before the elements of the world, before all the guns, fists, knives, crack, rape, and disease.” Throughout the book, Coates describes being in numb-inducing fear for the safety of his own body. This work, which won the National Book Award in nonfiction, is something to behold: a mature writer entirely consumed by a momentous subject and working at the extreme of his considerable powers when national events most conform to his vision.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
        BY JIM SHEPARD</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
        In the summer of 1942, German soldiers expelled almost 200 starving children from an orphanage in the Warsaw Ghetto and packed them into rail cars bound for Treblinka. Drawing on his imagination and dozens of historical sources, Shepard brings the Warsaw orphanage to life in this remarkable novel about a poor Polish boy and his friendship with the caretaker of the orphans, the pediatrician Janusz Korczak. The novel hangs on the delicate tension in the adolescent narrator’s deadpan voice — never cute, never cloying. Aron relays his world just as he experiences it: “The next morning my father told me to get up,” he says, “because it was war and the Germans had invaded.” And with that news, his town slides into hell. Although relentless in its portrayal of systematic evil, “The Book of Aron” is nonetheless a story of such candor about the complexity of heroism that it challenges us to greater courage.</p>

        The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
        BY JON MEACHAM</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
        Jon Meacham’s new biography of George H.W. Bush accomplishes a neat trick. It completes the historical and popular rehabilitation of its subject, though it does by affirming, not upending, common perceptions of America’s 41st president. In Meacham’s telling, Bush indeed lacked an ideological vision, was as overmatched in domestic policy as he was masterful on the global stage, benefited from his family’s influence, and remains overshadowed “by the myth of his predecessor and the drama of his sons’ political lives.”
